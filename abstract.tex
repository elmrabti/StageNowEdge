\chapter*{Abstract}


This report concerns the internship at the end of the first year of the engineering cycle, software engineering sector
at the Higher School of Computer Science and Systems Analysis
The subject of this project was the migration of serious games built by the company to a new
LMS (learning management system) and then perform unit tests on the LMS
Our work was done on two pillars: Migrating serious games to the new LMS and
perform unit tests on all the features of the latter. Thanks to the help of my supervisor, I learned,
over the past few months, using different tools and discovering several concepts that have helped us achieve
to the requested objectives. We will therefore present to you throughout this report, the steps we have followed
as well as the tools we used to carry out our project.
