\chapter*{Abstract}


This report concerns the project for the end of the second year of the engineering cycle, software engineering sector at the Ecole Supérieure d'Informatique et d'Analyse des Systèmes

The subject of this project was the management of patient data in a multi-center system.

  Our work was done in several phases:
  An analysis and design phase and a development phase.
  Thanks to the help of our supervisor, we have learned, over the past few months, to use
different tools and discover several concepts that helped us to develop this application.
  We will therefore present to you throughout this report the steps we have
followed as well as the tools we used to carry out our project.
